        <h2>An Introduction to Basketball </h2>
        <p>Basketball is one of these sports that has grown in popularity across the globe, specifically the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA. The sport was created by James Naismith in the late 1800s. 
            Since then, the sport has grown stastically, with some of the greatest players in the world including Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry. The sport is played on a rectangular court with two teams of five players each. The objective is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop.
            The sport used to be fairly simple, but as any good thing does, basketball has evolved into a more complex and exciting sport. The dunk and three pointer have helped define the game fairly recently, and athletes have become more competitive. Most NBA players are bigger, faster, stronger, and more skilled than ever before. The other 
            recent development of the sport has been the rise in women's basketball, thanks to some very recent talent entering the WNBA league including Sabrina Ionscu, Breanna Stewart, Caitlin Clark, and many others. The sport has grown from a small part of the global basketball landscape to a business that has global reach and impact across the world. 
            It personally has been my favorite sport to watch and play because it encompasses a lot of different skills and athleticim. The skill of dribbling, shooting, passing, running, and communicating with a team poses a challenge everytime I, along with many others, step on the court. 
            However, at the end of the day, it is a team sport that leverages communication, teamwork, and strategy to beat the opponent.
