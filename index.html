        <h2>An Introduction to my Life and My Interests</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Sophie, and I am a 4th year at Northeasterun University studying finance, entrepreneurship, and data science. I am originally from Western Massachusetts  In terms of my interests, I am incredibly interested in sports, specifically basketball and tennis. 
            I grew up playing basketball, and have played since I was in elementary school. I since have retired from my basketball career, but have still been an avid follower of the NBA and NCAA basketball. My favorite college team is Duke, and
            I am a huge fan of the Celtics, Lakers, Heat, and Warriors. I have also loved playing and watching tennis because I find it to be an incredibly theraputic sport to play but an exciting sport to watch. My favorite players are Serena Williams, 
            Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer. As for other passions of mine, I love cooking and baking! I cook because my parents are not the best cooks (sorry mom) and find the kitchen to be both challenging and theraputic. The challenge of taking random ingredients
            and combining them together to make a cohesive mealis something I find incredibly rewarding, and recieving the gratification of people enjoying the meal is an even better part. To learn more about basketball, I have created a seperate page on this site dedicated to 
            basketball fun facts, statistics, and photos. Please click on the "About" page to learn more niche facts about the sport! Thanks for reading about me!</p>
